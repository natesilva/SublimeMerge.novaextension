## Requirements

This extension requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

- [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com)
- The [smerge command-line utility](https://www.sublimemerge.com/docs/command_line), if you want to use the “blame” and file history features.

## Usage

To access the commands:

- Open the command palette and type `Sublime Merge`

The available workspace commands are:

- **Open Workspace in Sublime Merge**

The following commands are available when editing a file that has previously been saved:

- **Blame in Sublime Merge**—show the Git blame view in Sublime Merge
- **View file history in Sublime Merge**—show the file’s history in Sublime Merge

To set keyboard shortcuts for any of the above commands, use Nova’s [key bindings](https://library.panic.com/nova/preferences/#key-bindings) feature.
